# UDGOAP_attempt
This is my (failed) attempt to implement UDGOAP. Sorry you had to see this.

Documentation: https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1177&context=sciendoc

It's a pdf, a doctoral paper, exploring in detail said AI system for directing game agent behaviour. The author explore all the parts, their properties and connections, in chapter 3, even to a degree of pseudocode for critical concepts.

As an absolute beginner to coding I tried to implement it myself, but it has bested me. Looking for someone who can make a proof of concept. No expectation of quality, but the core concepts should tick.

I am open to any discussion / questions.

The project is a complete hobby.
